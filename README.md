# tac-runner
This is an interpreter for the low-level intermediate TAC code generated by the [language bender compiler](https://github.com/jesuswr/language-bender), see the TAC code specification [here](https://github.com/LDiazN/TACTypes)!

# Requirements
You'll need the following tools to build this project:
* [bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
* [flex](https://github.com/westes/flex)

# Installing
This project it's available on linux only, and to install, just follow these steps:
* `git clone` this project
* `cd` into the root project folder
* run `make`

And that's it! You know have the tac-runner ready to go.

# Usage
After building, you'll have a new executable file `tac-runner`, you can use it as any other
command line tool to run programs. 
```
$ ./tac-runner --help
Tac Runner is a simple virtual machine capable of running tac code.
        Usage:
                tac-runner <name_of_file> [flags]
        Where:
                <name_of_file> : is the name of the file to be run, should be a valid tac code.
                 [flags] : Configuration flags, part of the following:
                        --help : Show this help
                        --memory : Show current memory state
                        --registers : Show registers
                        --labels : show current labels
                        --stack-mem-bytes n: show n bytes of stack memory
```

As the `--help` message suggests, the tac-runner tool is like a tiny little virtual machine tailored for the
TAC intermediate code. You can check the memory, registers, currently running line, and more!

# Samples
You can find a few code samples in the `test_files` folders. For example, you can run the recursive version of 
fibonacci using:

```bash
./tac-runner test_files/fib_rec.tac
```
> Beware of big numbers, the word size is 4 (32 bits registers) so it might overflow quickly

This program will prompt you to input 1 if you want to test the fibonacci or 0 if you want to quit (Yes, it has input!). Then, if you choose 1, it will ask you for an
input number and it will print its fibonacci number. For example:
```
DE 0 PARA TERMINAR O 1 PARA FIB REC
1
INTRODUZCA UN NUMERO MAYOR O IGUAL QUE 0
10
55
```
