# tac-runner
This is an interpreter for the low-level intermediate TAC code generated by the [language bender compiler](https://github.com/jesuswr/language-bender), see the TAC code specification [here](https://github.com/LDiazN/TACTypes)!

# Requirements
You'll need the following tools to build this project:
* [bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
* [flex](https://github.com/westes/flex)

# Installing
This project it's available on linux only, and to install, just follow these steps:
* `git clone` this project
* `cd` into the root project folder
* run `make`

And that's it! You know have the tac-runner ready to go.

# Usage
After building, you'll have a new executable file `tac-runner`, you can use it as any other
comman line tool to run programs. 
```
$ ./tac-runner --help
Tac Runner is a simple virtual machine capable of running tac code.
        Usage:
                tac-runner <name_of_file> [flags]
        Where:
                <name_of_file> : is the name of the file to be run, should be a valid tac code.
                 [flags] : Configuration flags, part of the following:
                        --help : Show this help
                        --memory : Show current memory state
                        --registers : Show registers
                        --labels : show current labels
                        --stack-mem-bytes n: show n bytes of stack memory
```

As the `--help` message suggests, the tac-runner tool is like a tiny little virtual machine tailored for the
TAC intermediate code. You can check the memory, registers, currently running line, and more!
